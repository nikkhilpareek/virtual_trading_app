You know how to place a trade, but how do you decide which stock to buy or sell? And when?

This is the art and science of analysis. All real-world trading strategies are built on two main pillars. Think of them as two different toolkits for making decisions.

Fundamental Analysis (FA): The "business detective" method.

Technical Analysis (TA): The "chart reader" method.

Professionals rarely use just one; they use a mix of both.

Module 3.1: Fundamental Analysis (What to Buy)
The Big Idea: Fundamental Analysis ignores the daily price blips. It focuses on the business itself to determine its "true" or "intrinsic" value.

The Key Question: "Is this a good, healthy, and profitable company that is priced fairly?"

1. The "Big 3" Financial Statements
To be a fundamental analyst, you must become a business detective. Your clues are found in three key reports every public company must release:

The Income Statement (P&L):

What it is: A report card for a set period (like a quarter or a year).

It answers: "How much money did the company make (Revenue) and how much did it keep (Net Profit)?"

The Balance Sheet:

What it is: A snapshot of the company at a single point in time.

It answers: "What does the company own (Assets) and what does it owe (Liabilities)?"

The Cash Flow Statement:

What it is: Tracks all the real cash moving in and out of the business.

It answers: "Is the company actually generating cash?" (Many pros trust this most, as "profit" can be an accounting term, but "cash" is real.)

2. Key Ratios: Your "Detective Toolkit"
You don't need to be an accountant. Ratios do the hard work for you. They help you quickly compare a company to its competitors.

P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings):

What it is: Stock Price / Earnings Per Share

What it tells you: How "expensive" a stock is. A high P/E (e.g., 50) means investors are paying ₹50 for every ₹1 of the company's profit. This might mean it's "overvalued," or it might mean investors expect huge growth.

EPS (Earnings Per Share):

What it is: Company's Net Profit / Number of Shares

What it tells you: The amount of profit for each single share. You want to see this number growing consistently over time.

D/E Ratio (Debt-to-Equity):

What it is: Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity

What it tells you: How much debt the company is using to grow. A high D/E ratio can be a red flag; it means the company is high-risk if a slowdown hits.

Dividend Yield:

What it is: Annual Dividend Per Share / Stock Price

What it tells you: How much the company pays you back in dividends each year as a percentage of the stock's price. (Not all companies pay dividends).

Module 3.2: Technical Analysis (When to Buy/Sell)
The Big Idea: Technical Analysis ignores the company's fundamentals. It focuses 100% on price charts and trading volume.

The Key Question: "Based on market psychology and past patterns, is the price more likely to go up or down right now?"

The core belief is that all known information (news, earnings, etc.) is already reflected in the stock's price.

1. How to Read a Candlestick Chart
This is the language of technical traders. Each "candle" shows the price story for a specific period (e.g., one day).

The Body (The colored part): Shows the open and close price.

Green: The price closed higher than it opened (a winning day).

Red: The price closed lower than it opened (a losing day).

The Wicks (The thin lines): Show the highest and lowest price the stock hit during that period.

2. Key Concepts: The Building Blocks
Support & Resistance: These are the most important concepts in TA.

Support: A price "floor" where a falling stock tends to stop, find buyers, and "bounce" back up.

Resistance: A price "ceiling" where a rising stock tends to stall, find sellers, and be "rejected" back down.

The Rule: Trade with these levels. (e.g., consider buying near support, or selling near resistance).

Trends:

Uptrend: A series of "higher highs" and "higher lows." (Looks like stairs going up).

Downtrend: A series of "lower highs" and "lower lows." (Looks like stairs going down).

The #1 rule of trading: "The trend is your friend." It's easier to swim with the current than against it.

3. Common Indicators: Your "Dashboard"
Indicators are visual tools you add to your chart to help you make decisions.

Moving Averages (MA):

What it is: A simple, smoothed-out line that shows the average price over a period (e.g., a 50-day or 200-day MA).

How to use it: It helps you see the true trend by ignoring the "noise." (e.g., "Is the price currently above its 50-day moving average? That's a sign of strength.")

RSI (Relative Strength Index):

What it is: A momentum indicator that moves between 0 and 100.

How to use it: It shows when a stock might be "Overbought" or "Oversold."

Overbought (RSI > 70): The stock has gone up too fast and might be due for a pullback (a drop).

Oversold (RSI < 30): The stock has fallen too fast and might be due for a bounce (a rise).

Practice What You've Learned
Reading this is step one. Step two is seeing it in action.

This is the perfect time to use our simulator.

Fundamental Test: Find two companies in the same industry (e.g., two different banks). Look up their P/E ratios. Which one is "cheaper"?

Technical Test: Open the chart for any stock. Can you draw a horizontal line that acts as Support? Watch the live price and see if it "bounces" off your line.

Try to find a stock that is "oversold" (RSI below 30) and place a virtual trade. See what happens next. You can test every real-world strategy you learn, all with zero fear of losing real money.
