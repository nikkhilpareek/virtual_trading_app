A strategy is your personal set of rules for what to buy, when to buy, and — most importantly — when to sell. This lesson covers the three core pillars of every real‑world trading plan.

## 1. Investing vs. Trading — What's Your Timeframe?

First, decide what game you're playing. Your strategy changes completely based on timeframe.

### Investing (Long‑Term) 🌳
- **Goal:** Build wealth steadily over time (buy and hold).  
- **Time horizon:** Years to decades.  
- **Primary tool:** Fundamental analysis (see Lesson 3.1).  
- **Mindset:** Patient part‑owner of a business. Daily swings are noise.

### Trading (Short‑Term) ✈️
- **Goal:** Generate more frequent profits from price movements (swing trading).  
- **Time horizon:** Days, weeks, or months.  
- **Primary tool:** Technical analysis (see Lesson 3.2).  
- **Mindset:** Active, disciplined navigator of market trends.

There is no "better" way — they are different. Use the simulator to discover which fits you.

## 2. Risk Management — The Most Important Lesson

Professionals aren't better at always winning; they're better at not losing. Protect your (virtual) capital with two core rules.

### Rule #1 — Stop‑Loss (Your Safety Net)
Know your exit before you enter. A stop‑loss removes emotion: set it, and let it do its job.

### Rule #2 — Position Sizing (How Much to Risk)
Answer the question: "How many shares should I buy?" Use the 1% Rule (or 2% if more aggressive).

- **Rule:** Never risk more than 1% of your total account value on a single trade.

Example calculation:
```
Account value: ₹1,00,000
Max risk (1%): ₹1,000
Entry price: ₹100
Stop‑loss: ₹90
Risk per share = ₹100 - ₹90 = ₹10
Shares to buy = Max risk / Risk per share = 1,000 / 10 = 100 shares
```
This ensures a single failed trade costs only ₹1,000 (1% of the account).

## 3. Diversification — Don't Put All Your Eggs in One Basket 🧺

Diversify to limit the impact of any single failure.

- If one stock fails and you had 100% in it, you lose 100%.
- If you split across 10 stocks with 10% each and one fails, you lose 10%.

How to diversify:
- **Across industries:** Don’t buy 5 tech stocks — spread across sectors (tech, finance, healthcare, auto, etc.).  
- **Across asset types:** (Advanced) Mix stocks with bonds, gold, etc.  
- **Easy mode:** Use ETFs — one ETF can hold hundreds of stocks (e.g., a Nifty 50 ETF gives instant exposure to 50 large companies).

## Practice What You've Learned

Your mission:
1. Open your virtual portfolio.  
2. Decide: Investor (long‑term) or Trader (short‑term).  
3. Find 5 stocks in different industries (using FA or TA).  
4. For each trade, use the 1% Rule to calculate position size.  
5. Place the virtual trade and immediately set your stop‑loss.

You’ll learn far more by doing than by reading — and it costs nothing to try.
