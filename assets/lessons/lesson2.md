In Lesson 1 you learned what a stock is. This lesson explains the exact terms and order types you’ll use every time you trade — the technical “how‑to” for buying and selling.

## 1. How to Read a Stock Quote
When you look up any stock (e.g., RELIANCE or TCS) you’ll see a dashboard of numbers. Key items:

- **Last Traded Price (LTP):** The price at which the last trade occurred — the most recent executed price.  
- **Change (%):** Movement (points and percentage) since market open.  
- **Open:** Price at the start of the trading day.  
- **High / Low:** Highest and lowest prices for the stock so far today.  
- **52‑Week High / Low:** Highest and lowest prices over the past year — useful for long‑term context.

## 2. The Real Price: Bid vs. Ask
The LTP is historical. The price you trade at is determined by:

- **Bid Price:** Highest price a buyer is currently willing to pay.  
- **Ask Price:** Lowest price a seller is currently willing to accept.  
- **Spread:** The small gap between Bid and Ask.

Example: Buyers may bid `₹100.00`, sellers ask `₹100.05`.  
To buy immediately you pay the Ask; to sell immediately you accept the Bid.

## 3. How to Buy: Main Order Types
When you click “Buy” you give the market instructions. The two basic order types:

### Market Order
- What it is: “Buy this stock now at the best available price.”  
- How it works: Matched immediately with the lowest available Ask.  
- Pro: Fast and fills quickly.  
- Con: No price control — possible slippage in fast markets.

### Limit Order
- What it is: “Buy this stock only if the price is `₹X` or lower.”  
- How it works: You set a maximum price. The order waits until the market reaches that price.  
- Pro: Control over the exact price.  
- Con: Order may never fill if the market doesn’t reach your limit.

## 4. How to Sell: The Most Important Order
You can sell with Market or Limit orders, but for risk management the critical tool is the **Stop‑Loss**.

### Stop‑Loss Order
- What it is: An automatic sell order that triggers if the price falls to a set level.  
- How it works: Example — you buy at `₹100` and set a stop‑loss at `₹90`. If the price drops to `₹90`, the stop triggers and the shares are sold at the next available market price.  
- Why it’s crucial: Removes emotion and limits downside risk.

## Time to Practice
Reading isn’t enough — use the simulator:

1. Place a Market Order to buy a stock and feel the speed.  
2. Immediately set a Stop‑Loss on that position to protect against loss.  
3. Place a Limit Order below the current price and see if it gets filled.

Test every order type in the simulator to build confidence with zero real‑money risk.
