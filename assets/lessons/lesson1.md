This section is for users who are brand new to the stock market. The goal is to make you feel comfortable with the core concepts and terminology.

## 1. What is a Stock (or Share)?
Ever wanted to own a piece of your favorite company? That's exactly what a stock is.

A stock (also called a "share" or "equity") represents a small piece of ownership in a public company.

*Analogy:* Think of a company like a giant pizza. Buying one share is like buying one slice of that pizza. When you do, you become a part-owner (a shareholder).

Why do companies sell shares? They raise money (capital) from the public to grow the business, build facilities, hire people, or develop products.

## 2. What is the Stock Market?
The stock market is where you buy and sell those "slices" of companies. It is not a single physical place but a global network of exchanges ‚Äî a digital marketplace for stocks, bonds, and other financial assets.

In India, the two main exchanges are the NSE (National Stock Exchange) and the BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange).

## 3. The 5-Minute Lingo: Must-Know Terms
- **Bull Market** üêÇ ‚Äî A period when stock prices are generally rising.
- **Bear Market** üêª ‚Äî A period when stock prices are generally falling.
- **IPO (Initial Public Offering)** ‚Äî The first time a private company offers its shares to the public.
- **Ticker Symbol** ‚Äî A short, unique code for a stock on an exchange (e.g., `RELIANCE`, `TCS`).
- **Dividend** ‚Äî A portion of a company's profits distributed to shareholders.

## 4. How Do You Make Money from Stocks?
There are two primary ways investors earn from stocks:

- **Capital Gains** ‚Äî Buy a stock at one price and sell it later at a higher price.  
    Example: buy at $100, sell at $150 ‚Üí capital gain = $50.

- **Dividends** ‚Äî Periodic payments a company makes to shareholders from its profits. This provides income while you hold the stock.

## 5. What is a Broker (And Your Virtual Environment)?
You can't buy directly from an exchange as an individual; you trade through a licensed middleman called a broker.

Real-world accounts:
- **Trading account** ‚Äî Used to place buy/sell orders (your trading wallet).
- **Demat account** ‚Äî Electronic storage for the shares you own (your digital locker).
