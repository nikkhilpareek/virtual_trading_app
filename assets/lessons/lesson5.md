> **A WORD OF WARNING:** The topics in this lesson are for advanced traders. They are complex and use strategies that can lead to rapid and significant losses — in many cases you can lose more money than you initially invested. These are professional tools and require deep knowledge. Use the virtual simulator to practice in a 100% safe environment before considering real money.

## 1. Short Selling — Betting a Stock Will Go Down

So far you've learned to make money by "buying low and selling high." Short selling lets you profit if a stock's price falls — you are essentially betting against the company.

### What it is
Instead of "Buy, then Sell," you "Sell, then Buy."

### How it works (simplified)
- **Borrow:** Your broker lends you shares you think are overvalued (e.g., 10 shares of Stock XYZ at ₹100).
- **Sell:** You sell those borrowed shares on the market (10 × ₹100 = ₹1,000).
- **Wait:** If the price falls (e.g., to ₹80), you proceed.
- **Buy:** You buy back the 10 shares at the lower price (10 × ₹80 = ₹800).
- **Return:** You return the shares to your broker.
- **Profit:** You keep the difference (₹1,000 − ₹800 = ₹200), minus fees.

### The massive risk (read this carefully)
When you buy a stock at ₹100, the most you can lose is ₹100 (if it goes to ₹0). When you short at ₹100, the price can rise without limit — potential losses are theoretically unlimited.

## 2. Margin Trading (Leverage) — Trading with Borrowed Money

### What it is
Leverage (trading on margin) means using borrowed funds from your broker to open a larger position than your cash balance allows.

### Example
- Your broker offers 2× leverage.
- You have ₹50,000.
- With 2× leverage you can control ₹100,000 of stock.

Why it's tempting (the good):
- You buy ₹100,000 of Stock ABC. It rises 10% → position = ₹110,000 → profit ₹10,000.
- Since you used ₹50,000, that's a 20% return on your capital.

Why it's dangerous (the bad):
- The same 10% drop turns the position to ₹90,000 → loss ₹10,000.
- That's a 20% loss on your capital. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses and can quickly wipe out an account.

## 3. Introduction to Derivatives (Options & Futures)

Derivatives are contracts whose value derives from an underlying asset (e.g., a stock, index, or commodity). They are complex and carry significant risk.

### Options
- **What it is:** An option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a specified strike price by a specified expiration date.
- **Types:**
    - **Call Option:** Buy if you are bullish (expect the price to rise).
    - **Put Option:** Buy if you are bearish (expect the price to fall).
- **Risk:** Options expire. If your view on price or timing is wrong, the contract can expire worthless — you can lose 100% of the premium paid.

### Futures
- **What it is:** A futures contract obligates you to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date.
- **Difference vs Options:** Options give a right; futures create an obligation.
- **Risk:** Futures are highly leveraged and can move quickly. They are typically used by institutions and experienced traders and are extremely risky for beginners.

## Master these in the simulator

These tools are not for beginners, but understanding them helps you grasp how markets work. Use the simulator to practice safely:

- Short sell a virtual stock and observe what happens if the price rises instead of falls.
- Place a leveraged (margin) trade and monitor how quickly your P&L changes.
- Find the options chain, buy a virtual call or put, and hold it for a few days to see time decay and price sensitivity.

Learn the mechanics and risks in real time without risking any real rupees.
